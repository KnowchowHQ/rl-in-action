    "- 5x4 playground that provides a football/foosball-like environment.\n",
    "- A controllable player:\n",
    "  - always spawned in the top-left corner\n",
    "  - displayed as '⚽'\n",
    "  - can move North, South, East or West.\n",
    "  - can be controlled algorithmically\n",

    "    - The ball can be (tried to be) moved in four direction: \\['n','e','w',s'\\]\n",
    "    - Move the ball to an unmarked position: -1 points\n",

    "## Rewards\n",
    "- Reward is the signal that an agent receives after it performs an action.\n",
    "- The reward structure has to be decided by us. \n",
    "- The biggest challenge of RL is that reward is often sparse. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Set up\n",
    "- In our case the reward depends on the rules of the game and our goal.\n",
    "  - If the agent runs into an opponent, the game gets over and the reward is negative (penalizes the agent).\n",
    "  - If the agent makes it to the goalpost, the game gets over and the reward is positive.\n",
    "  - if the agent takes the ball out of the field the reward is negative.\n",
    "  - If the agent makes a valid move what shoud the reward be?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "- The default reward structure in our case is  `{'unmarked':-1, 'opponent':-5, 'outside':-1, 'goal':+5}`\n",
    "- This can be changed at any time by calling `set_rewards()`.\n",
    "- Taking the ball to an unmarked position seems like a small step towards reaching the goalpost. Why would we then ever want to have a negative reward for this type of manouver?"

    "\n",
    "- Technically this is equivalent to enumerating all such paths and ordering them by their discounted returns then picking the one with the highest return\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is not feasible as the number of paths grow exponentially (with 20 states and 4 actions, roughly 4^20)\n",
    "\n",
    "- We realized that although the number of paths is huge, all paths are made up of a small set of (state,action) pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We attempted to find the **highest return** for each of the 80 (state, action) pairs.\n",
